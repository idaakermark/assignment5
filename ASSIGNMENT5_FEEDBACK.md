Hi Ida!

Great stuff! You've clearly showed a good understanding of everything wee covered in the course, and have crate a very nice website!

As you can see below, the only main thing you missed was CSS prefixing - I suggest you look into it just for your own knowledge.

I happy to say because everything else was at a high standard you have met the requirements for a VG grade!

Congratulations!
